•  Resume Parsing: When a candidate submits a resume, the ATS scans and parses the document, extracting relevant information such as contact details, work experience, education, skills, and qualifications.

• Keyword Matching: The ATS then compares the parsed information against predefined criteria set by the employer, which typically include specific keywords, job titles, skills, and qualifications related to the job opening.
