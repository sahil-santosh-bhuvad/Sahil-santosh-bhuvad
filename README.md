Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are software tools used by employers to streamline the recruitment process by automating the initial screening of job applications. Here's how they generally work:

•  Resume Parsing: When a candidate submits a resume, the ATS scans and parses the document, extracting relevant information such as contact details, work experience, education, skills, and qualifications.

• Keyword Matching: The ATS then compares the parsed information against predefined criteria set by the employer, which typically include specific keywords, job titles, skills, and qualifications related to the job opening.
